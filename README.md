# ApplitoolsHolidayShoppingHackathon
This is my submission for Applitools Holiday Shopping hackathon for performing cross browser testing using Applitools Ultra Fast Grid.  

It makes use of the ***Ultrafast Grid*** where only 1 browser is instantiated on the local machine and all the processing(across all the browsers & viewports) is done behind the scenes(in parallel). This approach is super easy to code, super fast to execute & provides amazing reliability for your tests which you get by putting in a minimal effort.
